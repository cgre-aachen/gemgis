            🚀 Thanks for opening your first pull request in GemGIS! 🚀
            Please make sure you read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst) and follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
            A few things to keep in mind:
              - Remember to run the tests locally to make debugging issues easier.
              - If you need help writing tests, take a look at the existing ones for inspiration. If you do not know where to start, let us know and we will walk you through it.
              - All new features should be documented. It helps to write the docstrings for your functions/classes before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.
              - No matter what, we are really grateful that you put in the effort to open this PR!
