It is capable of preprocessing spatial data such as vector data (shape files, geojson files, 
geopackages), raster data (tif, png,...), data obtained from web services (WMS, WFS, WCS) or XML/KML 
files. Preprocessed data can be stored in a dedicated Data Class to be passed to the geomodeling package 
GemPy in order to accelerate to model building process. In addition, enhanced 3D visualization of data is 
powered by the PyVista package."""
